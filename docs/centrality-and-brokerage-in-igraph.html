<p>Proceed to place the data required for this lab (<code>SouthFront_EL.csv</code>, <code>SouthFront_NL.csv</code>, <code>Strike.net</code>, and <code>Strikegroups.csv</code>) also inside your R Project folder. We have placed it in a sub folder titled <code>data</code> for organizational purposes; however, this is not necessary.</p>
<p>In this lab we will consider a handful of actor-level measures. Specifically, we will walk through the concepts of centrality and brokerage on two different networks.</p>
<p>Centrality is one of SNA’s oldest concepts. When working with undirected data, a central actor can be someone who has numerous ties to other actors (degree), someone who is closer (in terms of path distance) to all other actors (closeness), someone who lies on the shortest path (geodesic) between any two actors (betweenness), or someone who has ties to other highly central actors (eigenvector). In some networks, the same actors will score high on all four measures. In others, they won’t. There are, of course, more than four measures of centrality.</p>
<p>For the centrality portion of this exercise, we’ll look at a subset of South Front’s YouTube network that we’ve collected using YouTube’s open application programming interface. Specifically, we will examine subscription-based ties among accounts (note the names are a string of what appears to be random combinations of letters and numbers) within South Front’s ego network (excluding South Front), which leaves us with a network of 310 subscriptions among 236 accounts. We will consider this network undirected for the “Centrality and Power” section, but directed for the “Centrality and Prestige” portion of this lab.</p>
<p>Next, we will turn to measures that operationalize various aspects of brokerage. For that section, we will demonstrate the concept of brokerage by looking at a communication network of a wood-processing facility where workers rejected a new compensation package and eventually went on strike. Management then brought in an outside consultant to analyze the employee’s communication structure because it felt that information about the package was not being effectively communicated to all employees by the union negotiators. The outside consultant asked all employees to indicate, on a 5-point scale, the frequency that they discussed the strike with each of their colleagues, ranging from ‘almost never’ (less than once per week) to ‘very often’ (several times per day). The consultant used 3 as a cut-off value in order to identify a tie between two employees. If at least one of two persons indicated they discussed work with a frequency of three or more, a tie between them was included in the network. The data accompany the book, “Exploratory Social Network Analysis with Pajek,” also published by Cambridge. Hence, we’ve shared the data with you as a Pajek file.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: <strong>igraph</strong> imports the <code>%&gt;%</code> operator on load (<code>library(igraph)</code>). This series of exercises leverages the operator because we find it very useful in chaining functions.</p>
</div>
<p>We will also be using other libraries in this exercise such as <strong>CINNA</strong>, <strong>DT</strong>, <strong>keyplayer</strong>, <strong>psych</strong>, <strong>scales</strong>, and <strong>influenceR</strong>. This might be the first time you use these, so you may need to install them.</p>

<p>If you have installed these, proceed to load <strong>CINNA</strong>, <strong>keyplayer</strong>, and <strong>psych</strong>. We will namespace functions from <strong>influenceR</strong>, <strong>DT</strong>, and <strong>scales</strong> libraries (e.g., <code>influcenceR::betweenness()</code>) as these have functions that mask others from <strong>igraph</strong>.</p>

<p>We will begin by calculating the four primary measures of centrality for undirected networks. Note that the eigenvector function (i.e., <code>evcent()</code>) returns a named list with three components, so we have to extract the vector including the scores (<code>$vector</code>). Note the centrality scores correlate 100% with their <strong>statnet</strong> counterparts (as they should).</p>
<p>We can calculate ARD/Harmonic closeness using CINNA’s <code>harmonic_centrality()</code> function. It generates raw scores, so if we want to normalize it, we need to divide by the number of nodes in the network less one.</p>

<p>Let’s now turn to Hubs (out-degree eigenvector) and Authorities (in-degree eigenvector), which we cannot run in <strong>igraph</strong>. Like <code>evcent()</code>, the <code>authority_score()</code> and <code>hub_score()</code> functions return a named list, so we must extract the vector of node scores using <code>$vector</code> .</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.6.1</span> Cutpoints</h3>
<p><strong>igraph</strong> has two functions that we can use to explore cutopoints (<code>articulation_points()</code> and <code>biconnected_components()</code>). However, <code>biconnected_components()</code> identifies both cutpoints (aka, articulation points) and bicomponents. The output of this function is a named list with five elements:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>no</code>: the number of biconnected components in the graph</li>
<li><code>tree_edges</code>: a list with sets of edge ids in a given biconnected component</li>
<li><code>component_edges</code>: all edges in components</li>
<li><code>components</code>: vertices in components</li>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.6.2</span> Cutsets (Key Player)</h3>
<p>Cutsets are sets of actors/nodes whose removal maximizes some metric. In Steve Borgatti’s original article (2006), he sought to identify the set of actors that maximized the level of fragmentation in a network. With cutsets, we indicate the size of the set.</p>
<p>We can get cutsets with the <strong>influenceR</strong> package. Here, we’ve only asked for a cutset of three actors because it is such a small network. If you run this repeatedly, you’ll notice that it will return different solutions. That’s because there are multiple solutions.</p>
<p>First, run the function.</p>

<p>Another package, <strong>keyplayer</strong>, offers more flexibility in the sense that you can choose what centrality measure you want to use to identify the initial set of seeds. Here we’ll use fragmentation centrality, which is what Steve Borgatti uses in the standalone program, <strong>keyplayer</strong>. We didn’t discuss fragmentation centrality above, but it measures the extent to which individual nodes fragment the network if they are removed. Other options include closeness, eigenvector, etc. (see <code>?keyplayer::kpset</code>). The function does requires an adjacency matrix as a input, though, so note the slight difference in commands. Additionally, the output is a named list, we will use the <code>$keyplayer</code> element.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">11.6.3</span> Burt’s Constraint</h3>
<p>Next, we will calculate Burt’s constraint and its additive inverse (autonomy).</p>
<p>To calculate constraint, we will use the aptly named function from the <strong>igraph</strong> library. Like the centrality functions, this one generates a numeric vector of scores for each node. As such, we can assign it to the graph vertices as an attribute. In order to calculate autonomy, we can substract the constraint from one.</p>
